This directory contains the Java configurator source.

To build on Linux/Mac, run `./build_jar.sh`. Commands will be similar for Windows.

For visual editing of the UI, open `src/TSDZ2_Configurator.java` in [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/) and it will detect the corresponding `.form` file and enable the GUI builder.
